    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const play2 = players;
    // console.log(players, play2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // play2[0] = 'Cris';

    // console.log(players, play2);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const play3 = players.slice();
    play3[0] = 'Cris';
    console.log(players, play3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const play4 = [].concat(play3);
    
    play4[0] = 'Eu';
    console.log(play3, play4);

    const play5 = [...players];
    
    play5[3] = 'Hehe';
    console.log(play5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = person;

    console.clear();
    console.log(person, person2);

    // person2.name = 'Cris';

    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.clear();

    person3.name = 'Cris';
    console.log(person, person3);
